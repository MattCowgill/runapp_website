      "contents": "\nThe terms of reference below have been proposed but not yet formally adopted by runapp\nObjective\nThe objective of this document is to set out the purpose for the founding of the R Users Network of Australian Public Policy (runapp) and lays out its intended objectives as a guide to the committee and the membership.\nPurpose of the group\nData analysis is becoming increasingly important in public policy and the public sector. R is a key tool used for data analysis. But, for a number of years, the R user community in public policy has operated in isolation. There are a number of R groups within bigger organisations (such as the PC and RBA) but their presence across the board has been small and limited. There are immense benefits to community R organisations as has been seen in the success of R user groups such as R-Ladies, ropensci and ozunconf.\nUnderpinned by the appreciation of open source tools, these groups and organisations are aimed at fostering a deeper understanding of R and building a community of users who might give back. It is with this ethos that the group was created. \nrunapp supports an inclusive and vibrant community of R users working in public policy and the public sector by curating resources for using R effectively; developing and maintaining packages for common tasks; and supporting more efficient and reproducible data analysis in public policy.\nWe do this by encouraging the take-up of R by people working in Australian public policy and the public sector through:\nCreating R resources that are relevant to both the tasks commonly undertaken by policy and public sector analysts, including resources that are specific to the use of Australian data;\nHosting workshops, seminars and other events to spread information about the use of R and for sharing tips and tricks;\nProviding a forum for code reviews, technical discussions, and advice for those who might not work in an organisation with many R coders or technical colleagues;\nIdentifying and developing packages that will be useful for users; and\nMaintaining a website and other communications channels like Slack to encourage communication among members about how to solve common R problems and common problems encountered when conducting data analysis in the public sector in Australia.\n\n\n\n",
